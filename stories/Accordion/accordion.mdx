   import { Accordion, AccordionContent, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger } from "@/components/ui/accordion";
   ```

3. Add the accordion component to your markup:
   ```html
   <Accordion type="single" collapsible>
     <AccordionItem value="item-1">
       <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
       <AccordionContent> Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern. </AccordionContent>

   </Accordion>
   ```
